"""Prompt templates for LLM-based transaction extraction."""

PRIMARY_PROMPT = """You are a financial data extraction assistant. Your task is to extract credit card transactions from the following bank statement text.

Extract ALL transactions and return them as a JSON array. Each transaction must have:
- "date": Transaction date in DD/MM/YYYY format
- "description": Merchant/payee name (clean, no extra whitespace)
- "amount": Numeric amount (positive number, no currency symbols)
- "type": Either "debit" or "credit"

Rules:
1. Extract EVERY transaction, do not skip any
2. Dates must be in DD/MM/YYYY format. Convert from any format you see.
3. Amount must be a plain number (e.g., 1234.56, not "Rs. 1,234.56")
4. "debit" = money spent/charged, "credit" = refund/cashback/payment received
5. Clean up merchant names - remove extra spaces, codes, reference numbers
6. Do NOT include balance rows, interest charges headers, or summary rows
7. If a transaction spans multiple lines, combine them into one entry

Return ONLY a valid JSON array. No explanations, no markdown, no extra text.

Example output:
[
  {"date": "15/01/2024", "description": "AMAZON PAY INDIA", "amount": 499.00, "type": "debit"},
  {"date": "16/01/2024", "description": "SWIGGY", "amount": 235.50, "type": "debit"},
  {"date": "18/01/2024", "description": "PAYMENT RECEIVED - THANK YOU", "amount": 5000.00, "type": "credit"}
]

Statement text:
{text}"""


HARD_MODE_PROMPT = """You are a financial data extraction expert dealing with messy, poorly-formatted credit card statement text. The text may come from OCR or layout-preserving extraction and may contain:
- Broken lines, missing spaces, merged words
- Misaligned columns
- Garbled characters or encoding issues
- Mixed languages
- Incomplete dates or amounts

Despite these issues, extract ALL transactions you can identify. Use your best judgment to:
1. Reconstruct broken merchant names
2. Infer dates from partial information (use context clues from surrounding transactions)
3. Parse amounts even if formatting is inconsistent
4. Determine debit/credit from context (Dr/Cr, +/-, column position)

Return a JSON array with:
- "date": DD/MM/YYYY (best effort)
- "description": Cleaned merchant name
- "amount": Numeric amount
- "type": "debit" or "credit"
- "confidence": A number 0.0-1.0 indicating your confidence in this extraction

Return ONLY a valid JSON array. No explanations.

VALIDATION_PROMPT = """You are a data validation assistant. Review the following extracted credit card transactions for errors and inconsistencies.

Check for:
1. Duplicate transactions (same date + amount + similar description)
2. Invalid dates (future dates, impossible dates like 32/13/2024)
3. Suspicious amounts (negative numbers, extremely large amounts > 500000)
4. Empty or clearly invalid descriptions
5. Incorrect debit/credit classification

Return a cleaned JSON array with:
- Duplicates removed (keep first occurrence)
- Invalid dates fixed or transactions removed
- Amounts corrected (absolute values)
- Empty descriptions marked as "UNKNOWN TRANSACTION"
- Each transaction having: date, description, amount, type

Return ONLY a valid JSON array. No explanations.
